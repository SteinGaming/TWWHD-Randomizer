Hello Mac User. Before you begin using the Wind Waker HD Randomizer there are some things to know:

1. You computer likely will not trust the randomizer because it isn't signed by a "trusted" developer.
   If this is the case, go to *System Settings* > *Privacy and Security* > scroll down and click the 
   option to allow the app to open anyway.

   Alternatively, if you get an error saying that the application is damaged, it's likely been put
   into quarantine by your computer. If this is the case, open up a terminal in the same directory
   as the randomizer application and type in the following command:

   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine wwhd_rando.app

2. Running the application by double-clicking it normally may result in the program crashing when
   you click the randomize button. To prevent this from happening, right click the application and
   select *Show Package Contents*. Then navigate to Contents/MacOS/ and instead double-click the
   wwhd_rando executable inside the folder. This will ensure that the randomizer doesn't crash.
